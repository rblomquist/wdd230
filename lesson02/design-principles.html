                <p>Hicks Law is the idea that if you present more choices to the user then it will
                take longer to make a decision. I feel like Mcdonalds mobile site utilizes
                this principle pretty well. They have many items on their menu, but they break it down
                into different categories. With fewer categories to choose from a decision can be 
                reached quicker.

                <h2>White Space</h2>
                <p>Amazon <br>
                <a href="https://www.amazon.com">Amazon.com</a>

                <img src="images/Amazon.jpg" alt="Amazon">
                <p>White space is defined as the space between design elements. It does not necessarily 
                have to be white, that is just the name given to indicate spacing between elements.
                Amazon does a good job utilizing white spacing. There are multiple elements on the page,
                but it is clear to see where one ends and the next one begins.

                <h2>Proximity</h2>
                <p>Netflix <br>
                <a href="https://www.netflix.com">Netflix.com</a>
                </p>
                <img src="images/Netflix.jpg" alt="Netflix">
                <p>When making a design related elements should be in close proximity to each other. this
                helps group related information and provids less clutter, more structure, and an easier
                interface for the use to make sense of the information provided. Netflix utilizes proximity
                by grouping their movie titles based on their category. There are a wide selection of movies
                and shows on Netflix but by keeping movies in the same genre in close proximity to other 
                movies in the same genre it allows for easier selection.
