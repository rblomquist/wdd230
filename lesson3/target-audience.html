        <h2>Scenarios</h2>

        <p>Sandra's donuts are the best donuts in town and all the locals know that! One such local recently 
        had to close his diner as more and more chain food companies have been moving into the area taking
        away business from his shop. Being a local herself she was saddened to hear of the loss of yet 
        another local business. She decided to join the local chamber of commerce to see what she could do 
        to help protect other local businesses from meeting the same fate.</p></br>
        <p>From the website Sandra hopes to:</p>
           <ul>
                <li><p>Network with other business owners in the community.</p></li>
                <li><p>Work with other said business owners and civil leaders to protect local interests.</p></li>
                <li><p>Promote own business to continue to provide the best donuts to the local populace.</p></li>
            </ul></br>

        <p>Bob and Alice are new to the area. They have finally built up the courage to get to know their 
        neighbors and they quickly become friends. Bob and Alice have recently moved from the big city
        where everyone mostly keeps tho themselves and are somewhat disconnected from the community.
        They are surprised to hear all the events their neighbors attend and wonder where they can friends
        local communities they ma be interested in joining. They are directed to the chamber of commerce
        that has listings of community events are resources.</p></br>
        <p>From the website Bob and Alice hope to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>Find community events in areas that interest them.</p></li>
                <li><p>Feel a sense of belonging they lacked in the more "distant" community.</p></li>
